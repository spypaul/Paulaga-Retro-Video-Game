## Desciption
This school project is codded in Verilog created on the Nexys 4 FPGA. I recreated a Retro Video Game similar to the Well-known, Galaga. A huge amount of state machines are created to determine the states of the objects, such as an explosion. The key part of the project is to create internal signals to represent the coordinates of the objects in the game. With different input from the keyboard, the objects will change their coordinates mathematically. When the Hcoord and Vcoord signals from the VGA controller match the objects' position(internal signals), the proper color will be assigned to generate the animation.
