## Desciption
This school project is codded in Verilog created on the Nexys 4 FPGA. I recreated a Retro Video Game similar to the Well-known, Galaga. A huge amount of statemachines are created in order to create the animation of the game , such as explotion. The key part of the project is to create internal signals to represent the cordinate of the objects in the game. With different input from the keyboard, the objects will change their cordinates mathmatically. When the Hcoord and Vcoord signals from the VGA controller match the objects' position(internal signals), the proper color will be assigned to generate the animation.
